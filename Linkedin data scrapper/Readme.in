What is Web Scraping?
As the name suggests, this is a technique used for extracting data from websites. It is an automated process where an application processes the HTML of a Web Page to extract data for manipulation such as converting the Web page to another format and copying it into a local database or spreadsheet for later retrieval or analysis.

What is Selenium?
Selenium is a Web Browser Automation Tool.

Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. It allows you to open a browser of your choice & perform tasks as a human being would, such as:

Clicking buttons
Entering information in forms
Searching for specific information on the web pages
What will we build?
We build a web scraping program that will scrape a Linkedin user profile and get the details of the recruiter. This tool can be used to generate data for Analysis.

If you would like to jump straight into the project, here is link to the repo on Github. https://github.com/boun7yhunt3r/Linkedin-profile-data-Collection

What will we require?
For this project we will use Python3.x. You can also use Python2.x but there may be some slight differences in the code.

NB: If you have Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 installed from python.org, you will already have pip installed.

We will also use the following packages and driver.

selenium package — used to automate web browser interaction from Python
ChromeDriver — provides a platform to launch and perform tasks in specified browser.
Virtualenv — to create an isolated Python environment for our project.
Extras: Selenium-Python ReadTheDocs Resource.
How do we automate the process?
Start by building up the search string.

a.      “We are hiring Delhi” – 57k people results

b.     “We’re hiring Delhi” – 65k people results

c.      “Hiring Delhi” – 280k results

d.     “I am hiring Delhi” – 57k people results

e.      “I’m Hiring Delhi” – 17k people results

f.       “We are hiring Delhi” – 12k results

g.      “We’re hiring Delhi” – 16k results

h.     “Hiring Delhi” – 78k results

i.      “I am hiring Delhi” – 15k people results

1.      Go through each search result and click on their profile :

a.      Copy the name of the person, their title and their most recent / current company name, and feed into excel sheet (Company Name should be the first company listed in their “Experience”)

b.      Make sure this person has “We are hiring Delhi” written in their profile

c.      Make sure this person is in Delhi – You can see their city in their profile
